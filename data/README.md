# Data directory

This directory stores raw, intermediate, and derived data generated or
used during the analysis.

Large third-party datasets are **not versioned** in this repository.
Only documentation files are tracked.

## Raw data

The original **Mouse pancreatic islet scRNA-seq atlas across sexes, ages,
and stress conditions including diabetes** is **not included** in this
repository and must be downloaded separately from:

https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/296237e2-393d-4e31-b590-b03f74ac5070

Downloaded atlas files should be placed in:

```
data/raw/
```

### Note on downloaded file names

When downloading the dataset from cellxgene, the file may be saved with
a UUID-based name (e.g. `49243c50-bf0c-4b10-87f8-55ec9f455399.h5ad`).

For consistency, the preprocessing notebook expects a standardized file
name (`mouse_islet_atlas.h5ad`).  
You may either rename the file manually **or** place the downloaded
`.h5ad` file in `data/raw/` and let the notebook handle the file name
automatically.

---

## Processed data

The `processed/` directory stores datasets generated by the
preprocessing pipeline (e.g. `mouse_atlas_filtered_ML.h5ad`).

These files are derived from the original atlas, can be fully
regenerated by running the notebooks, and are **not versioned** due to
size and licensing constraints.

```
data/processed/
```

---

## Outputs

The `outputs/` directory contains figures, plots, and tables generated
during the analysis notebooks.

All contents of this directory are reproducible and can be safely
regenerated.
